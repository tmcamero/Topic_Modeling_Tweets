Description of CSV data

This csv file was created using a Twitter API to collect tweets that contain “@mentalhealth”. 
The file contains columns for the username, original tweet, time date stamp, location, preprocessed tweet, and tokenized tweet.  
The preprocessed tweet is the original tweet less stop words, website links, some punctuation, and Twitter specific coding.  
The tokenized tweet contains only the words from the preprocessed tweet for analysis.
