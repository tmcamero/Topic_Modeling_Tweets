Description

People utilize social media platforms, such as Twitter, to find support, get information, and connect with people who are experiencing similar difficulties. 
As the stigma of mental health diminishes, people have been more willing to share their experiences online. 
Doctors and mental health workers can collect data from these platforms to learn what topics people are discussing online. 

By using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, this project analyzes tweets for topics.
